# If you have two or more VDRs and you like them to mutually share
# there DVB cards you might need to apply this patch first.
#
# This is a modified version of the patch for VDRs with BIGPATCH. 
# Thanks to p_body@vdrportal.
#
# IMPORTANT: As this patch does not only modify streamdev-server but
# also an exported method of VDR, you will need to
#
#         !!!!! RECOMPILE VDR AND ALL PLUGINS !!!!!
#
# Why do I need the patch?
# --------------------------
# Before switching channels VDR will consider all of its devices to
# find the one with the least impact. This includes the device provided
# by the streamdev-client plugin. Streamdev-client will forward the
# request to its server which in turn checks all of its devices. Now if
# the server is running streamdev-client, too, the request will again
# be forwarded to its server and finally you will endup in a loop.
#
# What does the patch do?
# -----------------------
# The patch adds the additional parameter "bool DVBCardsOnly" to VDR's
# device selection method cDevice::GetDevice(...). The parameter
# defaults to false which gives you the standard behaviour of GetDevice.
# When set to true, GetDevice will use only those devices with a card
# index < MAXDVBDEVICES, so only real DVB cards will be considered.
# Other devices like streamdev-client or DVB cards provided by plugin
# (Hauppauge PVR) won't be used.
