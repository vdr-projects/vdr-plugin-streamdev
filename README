1. Description:
---------------

This PlugIn is a VDR implementation of the VTP (Video Transfer Protocol) 
Version 0.0.3 (see file PROTOCOL) and a basic HTTP Streaming Protocol.

It consists of a server and a client part, but both parts are compiled together
with the PlugIn source, but appear as separate PlugIns to VDR. 

The client part acts as a full Input Device, so it can be used in conjunction 
with a DXR3-Card, XINE, SoftDevice or others to act as a working VDR 
installation without any DVB-Hardware including EPG-Handling.

The server part acts as a Receiver-Device and works transparently in the 
background within your running VDR. It can serve multiple clients and it can
distribute multiple input streams (i.e. from multiple DVB-cards) to multiple 
clients using the native VTP protocol (for VDR-clients), or using the HTTP 
protocol supporting clients such as XINE, MPlayer and so on. With XMMS or
WinAMP, you can also listen to radio channels over a HTTP connection.

It is possible to attach as many clients as the bus and network can handle, as
long as there is a device which can receive a specific channel. Multiple
channels homed on the same transponder (which is determined by it's frequency)
can be broadcasted with a single device.

Additional clients can be programmed using the Protocol Instructions inside
the PROTOCOL file.


2. Installation:
----------------

Let's say streamdev's version is 0.3.1 and vdr's version is 1.X.X. If you 
use anything else please exchange the version numbers appropriately (this
way I don't have to update this section all the times;) ).

After compiling the PlugIn as stated below, start either (or both) parts of it
by specifying "-P streamdev-client" and/or "-P streamdev-server" on the VDR
command line.

What's important is that the client requests a channel using its Unique Channel
ID. So, in order to find the channel at the server, it must have the same ID
that is used on the client. You can achieve this by putting the server's 
channels.conf on the client, preferably after scanning (in case you use 1.2.X
with AutoPID or 1.3.X).

If you want to drive additional Input-Devices (with different sources) on the 
client, you can merge the channels.conf files. VDR will detect if the local 
device or the network device can receive the channels.

Last, but not least you have to put the provided streamdevhosts.conf.example
into the "plugins" subfolder of your config-directory (which is equal to your 
video-directory if not specified otherwise), rename it to streamdevhosts.conf
and adjust it to your needs. The syntax is the same as for svdrphosts.conf, so
please consult VDR's documentation on how to fill that file, if you can't do
it on-the-fly. For example, if you didn't specify a separate config-directory,
and specified your video directory as "/video0", the file has to be put to
/video0/plugins/streamdevhosts.conf.


2.1 VDR 1.2.X:
--------------

It is recommended that you apply a patch to VDR that improves thread 
cancellation. You can work without it, but you _might_ have delays in switching
(especially when using VDR-to-VDR streaming) that are around three seconds. 

cd vdr-1.X.X/PLUGINS/src
tar xvfz vdr-streamdev-0.3.1.tgz
ln -s streamdev-0.3.1 streamdev
cd ../..
patch -p1 <PLUGINS/src/streamdev/patches/thread.c.diff
make [options, if necessary] vdr
make [options, if necessary] plugins

2.2 VDR 1.3.X:
--------------

cd vdr-1.X.X/PLUGINS/src
tar xvfz vdr-streamdev-0.3.1.tgz
ln -s streamdev-0.3.1 streamdev
cd ../..
make [options, if necessary] vdr
make [options, if necessary] plugins


3. Usage:
---------

Start the server core itself by specifying -Pstreamdev-server on your VDR 
commandline. To use the client core, specify -Pstreamdev-client. Both parts
can run in one VDR instance, if necessary.

The parameter "Suspend behaviour" allows you to specify how the server should 
react in case the client requests a channel that would require switching the
primary device (i.e. disrupt live-tv). If set to "Offer suspend mode" (the 
default), you will have a new entry in the main menu. Activating that will put
the server into "Suspend Mode" (a picture is displayed on TV). Then, a client
may switch the primary card to wherever it likes to. While watching TV (Suspend
deactivated), the client may not switch the transponder on the primary device.
If you set the behaviour to "Always suspended", there will be normal live-tv
on the server, but whenever a client decides to switch the transponder, the 
server will lose it's live-tv. Set to "Never suspended", the server always 
prevents the client from switching transponders. If you set "Client may 
suspend" to yes, the client can suspend the server remotely (this only applies
if "Offer suspend mode" is selected).


3.1 Usage VDR-to-VDR server:
----------------------------

You can activate the VDR-to-VDR server part in the PlugIn's Setup Menu. It is
deactivated by default. The Parameter "VDR-to-VDR Server Port" specifies the 
port where you want the server to listen for incoming connections. The server
will be activated when you push the OK button inside the setup menu, so there's
no need to restart VDR.

NOTE: This mainly applies to One-Card-Systems, since with multiple cards there
is no need to switch transponders on the primary interface, if the secondary
can stream a given channel (i.e. if it is not blocked by a recording). If both
cards are in use (i.e. when something is recorded, or by multiple clients), 
this applies to Multiple-Card-Systems as well.

3.2 Usage HTTP server:
----------------------

You can use the HTTP part by accessing the server with a HTTP-capable media
player (such as XINE, MPlayer, and so on, if you have appropriate MPEG2-codecs
installed). In the PlugIn's Setup, you can specify the port the server will
listen to with the parameter "HTTP Server Port". The parameter "HTTP Streamtype"
allows you to specify a default stream type, which is used if no specific type
has been requested in the URL (see below). The supported stream types are:

TS     Transport Stream (i.e. a dump from the device)
PES    Packetized Elemetary Stream (VDR's native recording format)
PS     Program Stream (SVCD, DVD like stream)
ES     Elementary Stream (only Video, if available, otherwise only Audio)

If you leave the default port (3000), you can access the streams like this:

http://hostname:3000/3
http://hostname:3000/S19.2E-0-12480-898

The first one will deliver a channel by number on the server, the second one
will request the channel by unique channel id. In addition, you can specify 
the desired stream type as a path to the channel.

http://hostname:3000/TS/3
http://hostname:3000/PES/S19.2E-0-12480-898

The first one would deliver the stream in TS, the second one in PES format. 
Possible values are 'PES', 'TS', 'PS' and 'ES'. You need to specify the ES 
format explicitly if you want to listen to radio channels. Play them pack i.e. 
with mpg123.

mpg123 http://hostname:3000/ES/200

3.3 Usage VDR-to-VDR client:
----------------------------

The parameter "Remote IP" uses an IP-Adress-Editor, where you can just enter
the IP number with the number keys on your remote. After three digits (or if 
the next digit would result in an invalid IP adress, or if the first digit is
0), the current position jumps to the next one. You can change positions with 
the left and right buttons, and you can cycle the current position using up 
and down. To confirm the entered address, press OK. So, if you want to enter 
the IP address "127.0.0.1", just mark the corresponding entry as active and 
type "127001<OK>" on your remote. If you want to enter "192.168.1.12", type 
"1921681<Right>12<OK>". 

The parameters "Remote IP" and "Remote Port" in the client's setup specify the 
address of the remote VDR-to-VDR server to connect to. Activate the client by
setting "Start Client" to yes. It is disabled by default, because it wouldn't
make much sense to start the client without specifying a server anyway. The 
client is activated after you push the OK button, so there's no need to restart
VDR. Deactivation on-the-fly is not possible, so in order to deactivate the 
client, you will have to restart VDR. All other settings can be changed without
restarting VDR.

The client will try to connect to the server (in case it isn't yet) whenever 
a remote channel is requested. Just activate the client and switch to a 
channel that's not available by local devices. If anything goes wrong with the 
connection between the two, you will see it in the logfile instantly. If you 
now switch the client to a channel which isn't covered by it's own local
devices, it will ask the server for it. If the server can (currently) receive
that channel, the client will show it until you switch again, or until the 
server needs that card (if no other is free) for a recording on a different 
transponder.

You can choose a remote streamtype in the setup. I'd suggest TS streaming as
it has a much shorter delay than PES streaming (compared to live-view of the
same channel on the server), and transmits more information such as AC3 and 
teletext data.

When setting the parameter "MultiPID streaming" to yes (the default) (only 
applies if the streamtype is TS), only the needed PIDs are transferred, and 
additional PIDs can be turned on during an active transfer. This makes it 
possible to switch languages, receive additional channels (for recording on 
the client) and use plugins that use receivers themselves (like osdteletext).

The last parameter, "Synchronize EPG", will have the client synchronize it's 
program table with the server every now and then, but not regularly. This 
happens when starting the client, and everytime VDR does its housekeeping 
tasks. The only thing that's guaranteed is, that there will be a minimum 
interval of ten seconds between each EPG synchronization.

The client has a Main Menu entry called "Streaming Control". This is used to 
control various aspects of the remote server VDR. Inside, you will find 
"Remote Timers", "Remote Recordings", "Suspend server" and "Synchronize EPG".

The "Remote Timers" entry gives you the possibility to edit, create and delete
the server's timers remotely. Every timer is synchronized before the requested
action actually takes place. This only leaves a very short time-span (of a few
milliseconds) in which a race-condition could happen.

"Remote Recordings" shows up all recordings that the server can access. Only
deleting recordings is implemented, yet.

With "Suspend Server", you can send the server into suspend mode remotely, if
the server is set to "Offer suspend mode" and allows the client to suspend.

Last but not least, "Synchronize EPG" starts a synchronization in case you 
don't want to do it regularly, or in case you just activated it and can't wait
for the first synchronization to happen by itself.

3.4 General Usage Notes:
------------------------

If there's still some debug output on stdout, please ignore it ;)


4. VDR-to-VDR client notes:
---------------------------

4.1  EPG data:
--------------

[ OUTDATED, see "Synchronize EPG" in 3.2 ]

4.2  Teletext / OSD Teletext:
-----------------------------

Usual teletext will probably not work on the client, if it has no DVB hardware.
I never tried, and probably I never will, so don't ask about it please ;)

Osdteletext-0.3.1 (and later) definitely work when used in MultiPID Streaming
mode.


4.3 AnalogTV
------------

Works with ivtv and analogue cards according to Andreas Kool.


5. Known Problems:
------------------

- Recordings & Timers on the client side could endanger Timers & Recordings on
	the server, as they will have the same priority (by default). Set the 
	default priority to i.e. 40 if you want the server to supersede the client.

- Sometimes, if you reload VDR too often (for example while recompiling), the
  driver can get "stuck" in some situations. Try a driver restart if anything
  you think should work doesn't before sending a bug-report :-).
	[ ADDITION ]
	In the meantime I have discovered that this error is caused by the all-
	mysterical UPT (unknown picture type) error :-(.
